/* wfe_autonomous_route.h -- S4 autonomous-parity routing policy (PURE).
 *
 * S4 of primary-as-manager: route the AUTONOMOUS surfaces (/v1/dev/submit with an
 * omitted workflow, and sweep filing) through the same request->workflow router
 * as the interactive surface, instead of silently defaulting to "build" /
 * "manual-review". This is the pure decision policy; the catalog load + the
 * wfe_router_decide call + the lifecycle_event logging are integration layers in
 * the server (rh_dev_submit / server_sweep) built ON TOP of this core, kept out
 * of here so the policy is unit-testable with no I/O.
 *
 * Rulings folded from the S4 design roundtable (2026-07-03, non-degraded 6/6):
 *  - Q2: the omitted-workflow floor is `managed-change` (a FULL-SPINE enforced
 *    workflow: review + gate.roundtable + terminal gate.deliver), NOT `build`.
 *    Autonomous submissions get the same manager spine as interactive ones;
 *    `build` preserves the weaker pre-gate.deliver posture and is reachable only
 *    by explicit name.
 *  - Q5 (the fourth invariant): the autonomous router's selectable set is a
 *    fixed FULL-SPINE allowlist that excludes read-only AND review-bypassing
 *    lanes -- a shaped proposal can at worst pick among spine-carrying lanes,
 *    never bypass review.
 *  - Q3: sweep candidates are UNVETTED; they always hit a human gate
 *    (`manual-review`), never an auto-executing lane.
