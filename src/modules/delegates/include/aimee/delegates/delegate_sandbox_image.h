/* Resolve the delegate-sandbox image for a delegate whose worktree/cwd is `cwd`.
 *
 * Precedence, most specific first:
 *   1. the repo's <git-root>/.aimee/project.yaml `sandbox.image` (travels with the
 *      project — the code declares its own toolchain image);
 *   2. a per-workspace `sandbox_image` override in aimee.yaml (the workspace whose
 *      root contains `cwd`; the longest matching root wins);
 *   3. the global `delegate_sandbox_image` default in aimee.yaml.
 *
 * Writes the image reference into out[cap] and returns 0 on a hit, or -1 if none is
 * configured — in which case the caller runs the backend default image. Only the
 * `image:` (pre-baked) form is resolved here; the build-from-spec form is a later
 * phase. */

 * Each package name must match [A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._+:-]* (no shell metacharacters

 * "in-use" | "kept-recent" | "within-max-age" | "aged-out". An image is removed only
 * when it is not in use, is beyond the `keep_min` most-recent, and (if its
 * created_epoch is known, i.e. > 0) is at least `max_age_secs` old. A zero/unknown
 * created_epoch is treated as old enough to remove. Pure. */

 * always retained regardless of age. `max_age_secs <= 0` means "any age" (0s floor);
 * `keep_min < 0` is treated as 0.
 *
 * When `dry_run` is non-zero nothing is removed; the report lists what WOULD go.

 *   {"removed":3,"kept":5,"dry_run":false,"images":[{"tag":...,"reason":"aged-out"|"in-use"|
