/* persona.h: server-owned persona registry.
 *
 * A "persona" is the primary agent's identity: a system-prompt persona text,
 * a principles block, session-brief hints, advertised delegate roles, and a
 * done-gate (check) delegate role + verdict marker. The built-ins
 * (engineer/novel/songwriter plus the read-only reviewers qa/security/reviewer/
 * architect) keep their PROSE in prompts.c (reached via the aimee_mode_t enum
 * path so engineer stays byte-identical); this registry adds
 * their metadata and loads arbitrary user/project personas from single-file
 * markdown definitions:
 *
 *   <project>/.aimee/personas/<name>.md   (project-level)
 *   <config_default_dir>/personas/<name>.md   (user-level)
 *
 * with YAML frontmatter (name/description/roles/check_role/check_marker) and
 * `## Persona` / `## Principles` / `## Brief` sections.
 *
 * Server-side only: clients reach personas over the aimee-server /v1 HTTP API,
 * never by reading these files directly. */
