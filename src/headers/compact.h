/* compact_body: THE single tool-result body-shrink algorithm, called by the
 * economizer's lazy whole-history lever (context_compress_view). It is a pure
 * transformer over the caller's output buffer:
 *
 *   - Never allocates `out`; the caller owns and frees it.
 *   - Never retains a pointer into `raw` or `cfg` past return.
 *   - Never writes past `out_cap` (always NUL-terminates when out_cap > 0).
 *   - Never applies a hard cap and never touches the Coordinate Closet — those
 *     are per-seam policy the caller owns (the lazy seam runs a net-shrink guard
 *     and nominates from the full body). Nomination is gated on the seam's own
 *     shrink-happened decision, which is why it lives in the caller, not here.
 *
 * This header used to describe a SECOND caller, the eager per-result seam
 * agent_compress_tool_result(). That function had no callers and no tests — a CI
 * gate once enforced its unreachability, listing it under `legacy_calls` beside
 * context_reduce and build_fold_view, until that gate was removed in 9d478dcaa6.
 * It has been deleted rather than left to imply a live path. Its consequence is
 * worth knowing: eager identifier conservation into history is NOT happening, so
 * the Coordinate Closet only runs on the lazy seam.
 *   - Output length is <= raw_len EXCEPT the JSON-summary path, which is bounded
 *     by COMPACT_JSON_SUMMARY_MAX; size `out_cap >= raw_len + COMPACT_JSON_SUMMARY_MAX`
 *     to guarantee no truncation of any strategy.
 *
 * Strategy, in order:
 *   1. Pass-through: content <= effective threshold (or compaction disabled).
 *   2. JSON structural summary: content parses as a JSON object/array.
 *   3. Head+tail: keep head_bytes + tail_bytes with a truncation notice between.
 *
 * cfg may be NULL to use built-in defaults. tool_name may be NULL to skip
 * per-tool overrides (the lazy economizer seam passes NULL — it operates on
 * deep-copied, mixed-origin history where a single tool identity does not apply;
 * per-tool thresholds therefore govern the eager seam only). Returns the number of
 * bytes written to `out` (0 for an empty body, which the caller treats as a
 * pass-through). On an internal allocation failure the body is copied through
 * (bounded by out_cap) rather than emptied, so a non-empty body is never dropped.
 *
 * NOTE: the former context_used/context_budget dynamic-threshold parameters were
 * removed with the move to this core — they were never passed non-zero by any
 * production caller (dead capability), so eager output is byte-identical. */
