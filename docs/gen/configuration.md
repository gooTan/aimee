# Configuration Reference

> Auto-generated from the canonical source tables by `scripts/gen-reference-docs.py`: config keys from `src/modules/config/config_fields.c` + `src/config*.c`, env vars scanned from `getenv()` in `src/`, and the workflow catalog from `server-go/internal/wfe/catalog.go`. Do not edit by hand; run `make -C src docs-gen` to regenerate.

This reference covers every configurable surface:

1. **Config-store keys**: the `aimee config` keys + config-file sections (below).
2. **Environment variables**: `AIMEE_*` runtime/deployment overrides.
3. **External & provider environment**: provider keys, endpoints, proxy, editor.
4. **Workflow engine**: workflow definition + custom-block (`blocks.yaml`) schema.
5. **Other config files**: `agents.json`, toolsets, guardrails.

CLI commands + flags are documented separately in [`cli-commands.md`](cli-commands.md).

Configuration lives in the per-`AIMEE_HOME` config store. Scalar keys in the table below are settable from the CLI:

```
aimee config show                 # print the effective config
aimee config get <key>            # read one value
aimee config set <key> <value>    # set one value
```

Structured options (arrays, nested objects: e.g. `ensemble.reference_models`) are not CLI-settable; they are written into the config file under the sections listed at the end.

## CLI-settable keys (92)

The everyday runtime surface. Deploy-time, advanced-tuning, and dev-only keys are still `aimee config set`-able but are filed into their own subsections below (and hidden from the Settings surface by default).

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `aimee_synthesis_model` | string | n/a |
| `aimee_with_llamacpp` | string | Whether THIS IMAGE bundles llama.cpp ("1" on the aimee-kb-*-llm variants). Set by the Dockerfile, not by an operator: it is a fact about the running image, and the setup wizard reads it to decide whether the local synthesis models can be offered at all. |
| `audit_action_enabled` | bool | Publish governed tool-action audit rows (default on); disabling it creates an audit coverage gap. |
| `audit_worm_enabled` | bool | Dual-write governed-action audit rows into the append-only, hash-chained WORM store alongside audit.log (default off). |
| `autonomous` | bool | Legacy mode flag. The current Go WFE records run mode at admission but does not branch scheduler behavior on it; human gates always park. |
| `cache_aware_rewrite_enabled` | bool | Rewrite prompts to align with the provider's prompt cache. |
| `cache_shaping_enabled` | bool | Enable prompt cache-shaping. |
| `claude_model` | string | Default Claude model (empty = CLI default). |
| `client_integrations_enabled` | bool | Auto-register aimee (MCP server, hooks, slash commands) into detected AI-tool user configs: Claude Code (~/.claude), Gemini, Copilot, Codex. Default-ON; set false, or export AIMEE_NO_CLIENT_INTEGRATIONS, to keep aimee out of every tool's global config and wire a single project by hand. |
| `code_cochange_git_enabled` | bool | Mine git history at `index scan` time into co_edited edges (files that change together in a commit), which blast radius already reads. Incremental and idempotent via a per-project HEAD marker; bulk commits (>25 code files) are skipped. Default on. |
| `code_trust_actuation_enabled` | bool | Use earned code-graph trust lessons only as an equal-score retrieval tiebreak (default off). |
| `cost_reward_enabled` | bool | Factor token cost into the reward signal. |
| `cost_reward_ref_usd_milli` | int | Reference cost (USD-milli) normalizing the cost reward. |
| `cross_verify` | bool | Enable cross-model verification of outputs. |
| `css_render_command` | string | Render backend for the #4-full computed-style oracle: a command reading {html,css} JSON on stdin and writing a computed-style snapshot JSON on stdout (run an isolated headless-browser sidecar). |
| `css_style_graph_enabled` | bool | Enable the CSS migration assistant's style-graph write path during indexing. |
| `db2_url` | string | Vault-backed DB2 connection URL; reads are redacted and writes bypass YAML. |
| `dedup_enabled` | bool | Deduplicate near-identical responses. |
| `dedup_window_seconds` | int | Window (seconds) for response dedup. |
| `default_persona` | string | Persona a fresh primary session starts as, and the persona draft roundtable panelists author with when none is set (default 'engineer'). |
| `delegate_graph_context_enabled` | bool | Prepend a structural code-graph context block (callers/dependencies of files a delegate task references) to the delegate prompt (advisory, fail-open, default off). |
| `delegate_sandbox_learn_packages` | bool | Learned toolchain for delegate sandboxes (default on). aimee captures the apt packages a delegate installs inside its `--network none` sandbox, records them per project (git root), and pre-bakes the learned set into that project's next sandbox image build. It augments a declared `.aimee/project.yaml` from+packages spec, or synthesizing one (FROM the resolved base + the learned packages) when none is declared. Best-effort: a learned build that fails falls back to the un-augmented image. The first delegate turn after a new package is learned pays a one-time image build. |
| `delegate_sandbox_package_access` | string | Runtime package-access policy for a `--network none` delegate sandbox. aimee always performs and logs the fetch (the delegate holds no outside socket); this selects how much: `proxy` (default) proxies package-manager fetches to any host through aimee for out-of-the-box functionality; `off` no runtime proxy (build-time installs + learned pre-bake only); `gated` host-allowlisted registries, off-allowlist requires human approval; `governance` allowlist from a governance provider, off-allowlist refused. |
| `delegate_sandbox_require_isolation` | bool | Fail-closed guard for the `--network none` delegate sandbox (default off). aimee always passes `--network none`, but some runtimes ignore it and give the sandbox real egress, defeating the package-access proxy. After the container starts aimee asks the host daemon whether a network with an IP is attached and always logs an error on a breach; when this is set, sandboxing is mandatory. A delegate always runs in its own container -- there is no in-process host path to fall back to -- and this additionally refuses on a breach or an unverifiable probe. |
| `embedder_api_key` | string | Bearer token for an external embedder endpoint (blank if it needs none). |
| `embedder_command` | string | Command that produces embeddings (overrides the endpoint). |
| `embedder_dims` | int | Embedding vector width. Leave unset for a bundled embedder - it declares its own width and the kb derives it (pinned > recorded > probed). REQUIRED for an external endpoint, whose width cannot be derived; valid to 4000, the DB2 column ceiling. A ONE-WAY DOOR once anything is embedded: DB2 records the width and refuses to start on drift. |
| `embedder_model` | string | Embedder identity. Written for a bundled model too, not just an external one: it is the registry key pooling and prefixes resolve from, and the value recorded against the corpus. |
| `embedder_url` | string | External embedder endpoint. A non-empty value IS the external embedder; empty means the model baked into this image variant (bekko-a25m at 384, or nomic-v2 at 768 on the -nomic images). |
| `extended_thinking_enabled` | bool | Ask for extended thinking on aimee's OWN Anthropic requests (default off). Sends the adaptive thinking config, and only to a model whose capabilities report that it accepts it -- a model nobody has reported that for is left alone rather than sent a shape the provider would reject. Off by default because thinking tokens are billed: enabling it changes spend, not just visibility. |
| `fidelity_check_enabled` | bool | Run the answer-fidelity judge on terminal-text turns (default off; requires kb_evidence_emit_enabled + ingress_preinject_enabled). |
| `gateway_pin_model` | bool | Gateway forces the proxied /v1/messages served model to the configured primary's model, overriding the client-requested model. Default off (the passthrough honors the client model); enable for single-model Anthropic-compatible shims. |
| `gateway_prevent_subagents` | bool | Gateway strips subagent-spawning tools (Task/Agent/etc.) from proxied requests so the served model cannot spawn subagents. Default off. |
| `guardrail_mode` | string | Guardrail enforcement mode: approve (default; a tool call needs approval, so an unattended delegate is blocked), prompt, or deny. |
| `guardrails_blast_radius_advisory_enabled` | bool | Surface a structural blast-radius advisory (graph-impacted files) before an edit (advisory, fail-open). |
| `guardrails_semantic_command` | string | External semantic-guardrail classifier command. |
| `guardrails_semantic_mode` | string | Semantic guardrail mode: off, dry_run, advisory, or enforce. |
| `identity_working_profile_injection_enabled` | bool | Inject the working-profile identity into prompts. |
| `ingress_audit_async` | bool | Audit ingress requests asynchronously. |
| `ingress_max_raw_scans` | int | Max raw-content scans per ingress request. |
| `ingress_preinject_assembly_budget` | int | Token budget for ingress context pre-injection. |
| `ingress_preinject_enabled` | bool | Enable `<aimee-context>` pre-injection on ingress (memory/code preview envelope on primary ingress turns; default on). |
| `ingress_trusted_proxy_secret` | string | Vault-backed shared secret for a trusted ingress proxy; reads are redacted. |
| `integrity_dry_run` | bool | Run integrity checks without enforcing. |
| `integrity_enabled` | bool | Enable the integrity gate. |
| `kb_api_bearer_token` | string | Vault-backed bearer for the aimee-kb API; reads expose configured state only. |
| `kb_api_http_port` | int | HTTP port the aimee-kb API listens on. |
| `kb_client_bearer_token` | string | Vault-backed server-to-KB bearer; reads are redacted; restart required. |
| `kb_client_url` | string | Remote aimee-kb API base URL used by aimee-server; restart required. |
| `kb_curator_extract_code_workers` | int | Parallel curator code-extraction workers, bounded to the synthesis service slot count. |
| `kb_curator_extract_docs_workers` | int | Parallel curator document-extraction workers, bounded to the synthesis service slot count. |

| `kb_evidence_embed_enabled` | bool | Drain evidence-index operations into evidence vectors. |
| `kb_evidence_emit_enabled` | bool | Emit evidence records from KB ingest. |

| `kb_mining_enabled` | bool | Enable background KB mining. |
| `kb_mode` | string | Setup/deploy mode: local starts a KB, remote connects to kb_client_url. |
| `kb_pdf_tier` | string | Structured-PDF pipeline preset: off (plain pdftotext, default) | basic (ingest+vector) | full (all stages). |
| `learning_router_enabled` | bool | Enable the learning router. |
| `max_iterations` | int | Per-turn iteration cap for interactive chat (default 15). |
| `max_iterations_delegate` | int | Per-turn iteration cap for delegate sessions (default 25). |

| `memory_rewrite_command` | string | External query-rewrite command. |
| `memory_rewrite_enabled` | bool | Enable query rewriting for recall. |
| `ocr_command` | string | OCR sidecar endpoint/command for structured-PDF scanned-page recognition (resolves like embedder_command; AIMEE_OCR_URL env fallback). |
| `openai_endpoint` | string | OpenAI-compatible endpoint URL. |
| `openai_key_cmd` | string | Command that prints the OpenAI API key. |
| `openai_model` | string | OpenAI model name. |
| `provider` | string | Default model provider. |
| `reasoning_cap_enabled` | bool | Cap the model's reasoning effort. |
| `require_aimee_git` | bool | Block a delegate from running `git` or `gh` in a shell (reads included) and redirect git/forge work to aimee's `git_*` tools, which execute on aimee-server where the forge credential stays in-process; delegates are also spawned without git/gh credentials. Note the env strip also drops SSH_AUTH_SOCK (no agent-backed SSH to any host) and neuters the global/system git config (default on). |
| `require_aimee_memory` | bool | Block agent writes to external file-based agent-memory stores (~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/...) and redirect durable memories into aimee's memory system via `aimee memory store` (default on). |
| `require_session_worktree` | bool | Fail closed on mutating ops outside an aimee-managed worktree (session-isolation guard; default off). |
| `subagent_ban_enabled` | bool | Prevent provider-native sub-agent tools when an aimee delegate is available, and install the matching client guardrails (default on). |
| `synthesis_api_key` | string | Bearer token for the synthesis endpoint (blank for a keyless or loopback endpoint). |
| `synthesis_endpoint` | string | The ONE synthesis endpoint, remote or loopback. Empty means synthesis is off, which is supported - embedding, search, recall and indexing never call it. On a *-llm image the container entrypoint sets this to loopback itself after starting the bundled model. |
| `synthesis_model` | string | Synthesis model. On a *-llm image this selects the bundled model to fetch and serve (gemma-4-E2B-it or gemma-4-E4B-it); otherwise it is the model label sent to the configured endpoint. |
| `synthesis_thinking` | bool | Let the synthesis model think before answering (default on). It measured positive-to-neutral everywhere it was tried. Global rather than per-stage, and the operator's call: turn it off only for a model that reasons past its output budget without answering. |
| `tsr_command` | string | TSR sidecar endpoint/command for structured-PDF table recognition (resolves like embedding_command; AIMEE_TSR_URL env fallback). |
| `typed_facts_enabled` | bool | Enable the typed-fact knowledge layer (master gate; default off). |
| `verify_cmd` | string | Command run after a delegated fix to verify it. |
| `verify_cross_project` | bool | Let `aimee git verify` span other projects. |
| `verify_enabled` | bool | Master gate for `aimee git verify` (default off). |
| `verify_prompt` | string | Prompt template given to the cross-verification delegate. |
| `verify_role` | string | Delegate role used for cross-verification. |
| `virtual_context_assembly_budget` | int | Token budget for virtual-context assembly. |
| `virtual_context_enabled` | bool | Enable virtual-context assembly. |
| `wfe_live_forge_enabled` | bool | Gate for the autonomous live forge (default-ON). When off, the forge provider is not registered and every forge op fails closed, so an autonomous run can never open or merge a real PR. Even on, each op re-checks this flag and the merge-target rail. |
| `wfe_proposals_autoscan_enabled` | bool | Automatically scan watched proposal directories; off requires explicit trigger.fire. |

| `ingress_compress_enabled` | bool | Enable ingress envelope compression: span-enrich code hits and fold code entries into recoverable `file:line` references (recover via code_span_get). Default on (~48% prompt reduction on code turns); turn off (or send `X-Aimee-Compress: 0`) for agentic ingress where the agent re-opens folded code so recovery round-trips can erase the saving. |

| `kb_pdf_ocr_enabled` | bool | OCR a scanned / no-text-layer PDF via the OCR sidecar at ingest so its text + geometry feed the normal citation path (default off; without it a scanned PDF is ingested asset-only). |
| `kb_pdf_tsr_enabled` | bool | Run the table-structure-recognition (TSR) sidecar at PDF ingest to turn table regions into structured kb_table_cells, surfaced via lookup_table (default off; degrades to text-only when the sidecar is absent). |

| `tool_output_max_bytes` | int | Per-result cap (bytes) on the model-visible tool output (read_file/bash/grep/glob/git_* results). 0 = built-in default (32768); any positive value is clamped to (0, 32768]. Set it lower to bound the bytes a single tool result adds to the prompt + history; the context-economizer (aggressive tier) compresses older results to keep history bounded. |

## Other top-level config-file keys (5)

Scalar keys read directly from the config root (not via the CLI allowlist above):

`db2_pool_size`, `economizer`, `modules`, `proxy_token`, `toolsets`

## Environment variables

The binaries read 228 `AIMEE_*` environment variables (scanned from `getenv()` in `src/`, excluding tests, plus the generic first-boot credential inputs). Depending on the setting, these variables either override config-store values or provide fallbacks when no explicit config value is present. Module-activation variables use fallback semantics; deployment and runtime wiring variables commonly override stored values. A credential may enter through an environment variable only as first-boot transport (for example, a Kubernetes Secret): startup seals it into Vault, scrubs the environment, verifies custody, and fails closed before any long-lived service starts. Credentials are never runtime environment or config-file storage.

### Paths & assets

| `AIMEE_NO_AUTOSTART` | If set, the client does not auto-start a local aimee-server. |
| `AIMEE_NO_CLIENT_INTEGRATIONS` | If set (to any value other than 0/false), aimee does not auto-register itself into detected AI-tool user configs (Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot, Codex). Overrides the client_integrations_enabled config; honored by the aimee binary and by install.sh/configure-hooks.sh. |
| `AIMEE_PRIMARY_CLI_INGESTOR` | Name of the primary CLI integration that owns session-ingest events. |
| `AIMEE_PROFILE` | Active working-profile name. |
| `AIMEE_PROJECT_ID` | Explicit project identity for an integration request. |

| `AIMEE_TUI_SESSION` | Identifies the TUI session. |

### Server runtime

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_API_MTLS` | Client-certificate mode: `off`, `optional`, or `required`. The managed server image defaults to `optional` so enrollment works before the durable roster promotes the listener to required. |
| `AIMEE_API_REMOTE_WRITES` | Legacy value: `off`, `data`, or `full`. Still parsed, but no longer authorizes user writes; non-off values warn and feed `remote_writes.global_ignored`. |
| `AIMEE_BACKGROUND_THREADS` | Background worker thread count. |
| `AIMEE_COMPUTE_THREADS` | Compute-pool thread count. |
| `AIMEE_DEPLOY_COMPOSE_FILE` | Path to the managed compose file the server-orchestrated deploy runs (default /opt/aimee/deploy/aimee-managed.compose.yaml). |
| `AIMEE_DEPLOY_ENABLED` | Set to 1 to enable the server-orchestrated deploy: the setup wizard runs `docker compose up -d` for the managed sibling service (aimee-kb) via a mounted Docker socket. Off unless the deploy compose sets it. |
| `AIMEE_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID of a GitHub OAuth App for the webchat "Sign in with GitHub" button; populates the github.com git credential. Public. Overrides the built-in default baked in via oauth_defaults.h. |
| `AIMEE_GITLAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID of a GitLab OAuth application (device flow enabled) for the webchat "Sign in with GitLab" button on gitlab.com. Public. Overrides the built-in default baked in via oauth_defaults.h. |
| `AIMEE_MGMT_STATUS_KEY_ID` | Identifier of the management-status verification key. |
| `AIMEE_MGMT_STATUS_PUBLIC_KEY` | Hex-encoded Ed25519 key used to verify management-status staples. |
| `AIMEE_MODULE_ROUNDTABLE` | Enable the optional roundtable module; invalid values fail closed to off. |
| `AIMEE_SEARCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT` | Permit the operator-configured search backend (`search.searxng_url`) to resolve to a private, loopback, or link-local address. Off by default: every outbound fetch is validated and pinned, so a self-hosted SearXNG on a LAN address is refused unless this is set. Deliberately an environment variable rather than a config key, because `config.set` is reachable from inside the running system and pointing the search backend at a cloud metadata address would exfiltrate instance credentials through a tool that looks like search. Set to exactly `1`; any other value is off. Never widens fetches of model-supplied or search-result URLs, which stay denied. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_HTTP_BIND` | TCP bind address for the server `/v1` HTTP listener (else UDS-only). |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_BIND` | Bind address that enables the server management listener when its full TLS configuration is present. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_ISSUER` | Expected issuer for management-plane bearer identities. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_JWKS_TRUST_BUNDLE` | Root-owned trust bundle used to verify signed management JWKS publications. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_STATUS_CLIENT_KEY` | Forbidden legacy private-key file setting. Startup rejects it; use AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_STATUS_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY as first-boot Vault input. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_STATUS_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY` | PEM private-key content for the management-status client, accepted only as first-boot transport and synchronously sealed into Vault before the server starts. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_STATUS_SECONDARY_LEAF_PIN` | Secondary management-status TLS leaf pin accepted during certificate rotation. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_TLS_KEY` | Forbidden legacy private-key file setting. Startup rejects it; use AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY as first-boot Vault input. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_MGMT_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY` | PEM private-key content for the management listener, accepted only as first-boot transport and synchronously sealed into Vault before the server starts. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_STARTUP_FD` | Inherited fd for startup-readiness signalling (service launch). |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY` | Optional PEM private-key content for first boot. The key is synchronously sealed into Vault and the environment is scrubbed; only the public server certificate may remain on disk. |
| `AIMEE_SESSION_THREADS` | Per-session worker thread count. |
| `AIMEE_SOCK` | Sandbox helper socket path. |
| `AIMEE_STAGE_GOVERNANCE` | Enable the governance stage in the canonical request pipeline. |
| `AIMEE_STAGE_MEMORY` | Enable the memory stage in the canonical request pipeline. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_ENV_OVERWRITE` | First-boot control flag allowing supplied credential values to replace existing Vault records. It is not itself a credential. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_KMS_HELPER` | Executable implementing the configured external KMS wrap/unwrap contract. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_KMS_HWM_DOMAIN` | Domain separator for KMS high-water-mark signatures. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_KMS_HWM_PUBKEY` | Public key used to verify KMS high-water-mark records. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_KMS_KEY_ID` | External KMS key identifier used for vault wrapping. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_PKCS11_LABEL` | PKCS#11 object label used for vault custody. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_PKCS11_MODULE` | Path to the PKCS#11 provider module. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_PKCS11_PIN` | PKCS#11 user PIN accepted only as first-boot transport; it is synchronously sealed into Vault, scrubbed from the environment, and loaded from Vault only when the HSM session opens. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_PKCS11_SLOT` | PKCS#11 slot identifier used for vault custody. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_TPM2_BLOB_PATH` | Path to the sealed TPM 2 vault-key blob. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_TPM2_NV_INDEX` | TPM 2 NV index used for anti-rollback state. |
| `AIMEE_VAULT_TPM2_TCTI` | TPM 2 TCTI selector. |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_EDITOR` | Per-webuser in-browser code-server editor (on by default; set to 0 to disable; needs a code-server binary, shipped by WITH_VSCODE images). |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_EDITOR_BIN` | Override path to the code-server binary used for the in-browser editor. |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_EDITOR_IDLE_SECS` | Idle timeout in seconds before a per-webuser code-server editor is reaped. Default 1800 (30 min); positive values are clamped to [60, 604800]; 0 disables idle reaping; malformed/negative/overflow values fall back to the default. An actively-open editor is kept alive by the proxy keepalive, so it is not reaped mid-session. |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_EDITOR_UID` | Dedicated service user the per-webuser code-server drops to (defence in depth; only honoured when aimee-server runs as root). |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_GIT` | Per-webuser webchat git surface: repo connect/clone, git ops (pull/commit/push/branch), per-host token + SSH-key credential intake, the workspace forge-token broker, project listing + session-dir resolution, and "Sign in with GitHub". It is on by default. Set the literal value 0 to disable the entire surface; all of those routes then return 503. Any other value leaves it on. Independent of AIMEE_WEBCHAT_EDITOR. |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_PASSWORD` | Optional first-boot webchat password paired with AIMEE_WEBCHAT_USER. The bootstrap record is sealed into Vault and removed from the environment before runtime-web starts. |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_USER` | Optional first-boot webchat username paired with AIMEE_WEBCHAT_PASSWORD. The bootstrap record is sealed into Vault and removed from the environment before runtime-web starts. |
| `AIMEE_WEBCHAT_USERS` | Optional first-boot webchat account registry. It is sealed into Vault and removed from the environment before runtime-web starts. |
| `AIMEE_WORKTREE_GC` | Enable/disable delegate-worktree garbage collection. |
| `AIMEE_WORKTREE_GC_DAYS` | Age threshold (days) for worktree GC. |

### Knowledge base (aimee-kb)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_CODE_INDEX_SOURCE` | Source label recorded for code-index ingestion. |
| `AIMEE_EMBEDDERS_FILE` | Path to the embedder registry the server reads for GET /v1/embedders (the setup wizard's embedder picker). Defaults to /opt/aimee/embedders.json, then scripts/embedders.json in a source checkout. The same file the in-container embedder reads, so one declaration drives the picker, the loading and the serving flags. |
| `AIMEE_EMBEDDER_HOST` | DNS name of the embedder sidecar container (aimee-embedder-a25m or aimee-embedder-nomic). Setting it makes aimee-kb issue the mTLS identities for the kb -> embedder hop into $AIMEE_HOME/embedder-tls at startup, independently of the synthesis hop. Unset for an external embedder reached over plain HTTPS, or when no embedder is deployed. The sidecar refuses to start without this material. |
| `AIMEE_EMBED_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | Deadline for one embedding HTTP call, default 180000. The previous hardcoded 30s was shorter than a cold model load plus a large batch, so the first request of a run could fail on a healthy embedder. |
| `AIMEE_KB_API_CA_BUNDLE` | CA bundle path for verifying the aimee-kb TLS certificate. |
| `AIMEE_KB_API_URL` | aimee-kb HTTP API base URL. |
| `AIMEE_KB_CACHE_TTL_S` | KB client cache TTL (seconds). |
| `AIMEE_KB_CONN` | First-boot KB connection string; sealed into the server Vault before long-lived startup. |
| `AIMEE_KB_EMBED_ALL_FILES` | Set to 1 to give EVERY indexed file a dense document vector, including source. Off by default because source files are already embedded by the code path, and embedding them a second time as prose was 82% of the doc-embedding token budget on a real corpus. Chunk rows are written either way, so lexical and FTS search over source is unaffected by this setting; only the redundant vector is skipped. |
| `AIMEE_KB_EMIT_ENROLL` | Emit a client enrollment token on KB start. |
| `AIMEE_KB_EMIT_SCOPE` | Scope for the emitted enrollment token. |
| `AIMEE_KB_HARDENED` | Require the hardened KB custody and transport posture at startup. |
| `AIMEE_KB_HTTP_BIND` | aimee-kb HTTP listener bind address. |
| `AIMEE_KB_JWKS_MANIFEST_ROOT_CUSTODY_ID` | Custody identifier for the key that signs JWKS manifests. |
| `AIMEE_KB_JWKS_PUBLICATION_HWM_CUSTODY_ID` | Custody identifier for the JWKS publication high-water mark. |

| `AIMEE_KB_MGMT_STATUS_SECONDARY_LEAF_PIN` | Secondary TLS leaf pin accepted during management-status certificate rotation. |
| `AIMEE_KB_MTLS_HOST` | Advertised mTLS hostname placed in the aimee-kb server certificate; the listener binds all interfaces. |
| `AIMEE_KB_MTLS_PORT` | aimee-kb mTLS listener port. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | OIDC audience for KB API auth. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_ISSUER` | OIDC issuer for KB API auth. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_JWKS_FILE` | OIDC JWKS file for KB API auth. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_LOGIN_AUTHORIZE_URL` | IdP authorization endpoint the login redirects to (https only). |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID` | OIDC relying-party client id; setting it enables the per-user login front end. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI` | This kb's OIDC callback URL (https, or http on loopback only). |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_LOGIN_SCOPE` | Space-delimited OIDC scopes for the login request; defaults to openid. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_LOGIN_TOKEN_URL` | IdP token endpoint for the code exchange (https, default port only). |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_MAX_TOKEN_AGE` | Maximum accepted age in seconds for a KB OIDC token. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_SCOPE_CLAIM` | OIDC claim carrying the scope. |
| `AIMEE_KB_OIDC_SCOPE_KIND` | OIDC scope-kind interpretation. |
| `AIMEE_KB_READ_TIMEOUT_MS` | Deadline for a single KB read issued by the client, in milliseconds. |
| `AIMEE_KB_RUNTIME_UID` | Numeric runtime user allowed to receive the management token-authority socket. |
| `AIMEE_KB_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS` | Deadline for a code-index scan request, in milliseconds. Scans are queued and drained by the ingest workers, so this bounds the REQUEST rather than the work. |
| `AIMEE_KB_STATUS_BIND` | Bind address for the management-status authority. |
| `AIMEE_KB_STATUS_DSN` | Runtime database URL used by the management-status authority; secret. |
| `AIMEE_KB_STATUS_PORT` | Listen port for the management-status authority. |
| `AIMEE_KB_STATUS_PROVISION_DSN` | Provisioning database URL used to initialize management-status state; secret. |
| `AIMEE_KB_TOKEN_AUTHORITY_DSN` | Database URL used by the management token authority; secret. |
| `AIMEE_KB_TOKEN_AUTHORITY_SOCKET_GID` | Group allowed to connect to the management token-authority socket. |
| `AIMEE_KB_TOKEN_ROOTS_PROVISION_DSN` | Provisioning database URL used to initialize token roots; secret. |
| `AIMEE_KB_TOKEN_ROOT_CUSTODY_ID` | Custody identifier for the management token signing root. |
| `AIMEE_KB_VAULT_OPERATOR_ENABLED` | Enable the dedicated KB vault-operator runtime. |
| `AIMEE_KB_VAULT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` | Operator-configured vault orchestrator endpoint. |
| `AIMEE_LLM_HOST` | DNS name of the synthesis sidecar container. Setting it makes aimee-kb issue the mTLS identities for the kb -> aimee-llm hop into $AIMEE_HOME/synthesis-tls at startup, from the kb's own CA. Unset for an external or absent synthesis provider, which needs none of them. The sidecar refuses to start without this material. |
| `AIMEE_OCR_URL` | Structured-PDF OCR sidecar endpoint. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_ID` | Registry identity used by the server mTLS heartbeat. |
| `AIMEE_SERVER_TEAM_ID` | The team this server serves, from the same registry row as AIMEE_SERVER_ID. Required for per-user /v1 write authorization: unset, the server still starts and serves reads but denies every write with no_team_configured. |
| `AIMEE_TRANSPORT_KB_POOL_ENABLED` | Override server-to-KB mTLS connection pooling. The config default is on; set to 0 for one-shot connections. |
| `AIMEE_TSR_URL` | Structured-PDF table-recognition sidecar endpoint. |
| `AIMEE_VECTOR_KB_BATCH_SIZE` | Embedding batch size for KB vector ingest. |

### Database & vectors

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_DB2_EVAL_URL` | Separate DB2 URL used by evaluation harnesses; never the production default. |
| `AIMEE_DB2_IDLE_IN_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-connection `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` in ms, defaulting to the same pool stuck-lease ceiling (`DB2_POOL_HOLD_CEILING_MS`, 300000). `statement_timeout` bounds a STATEMENT, so a unit of work that opens a transaction and then stalls before its next statement is invisible to it and holds its pool member indefinitely. This measured at about 4.5 hours against a five-minute ceiling. Postgres ends such a backend itself, so the stalled thread unwinds and the lease is returned without a restart. Same value grammar as `AIMEE_DB2_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS`; exactly `0` opts out, independently of the statement bound. |
| `AIMEE_DB2_POOL_SIZE` | DB2 connection-pool size override. |
| `AIMEE_DB2_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-connection `statement_timeout` in ms. Defaults to the pool's stuck-lease ceiling (`DB2_POOL_HOLD_CEILING_MS`, 300000), because a statement must not outlive the duration that defines a lease as stuck. The pool can report such a lease but cannot reclaim it. The value must be canonical decimal digits with no sign, surrounding whitespace or leading zero. Exactly `0` disables the bound. This is a deliberate opt-out for genuinely long work. Every other spelling of zero (`00`, `+0`, `-0`, ` 0`) is treated as malformed. Anything malformed or out-of-range falls back to the default and never to unlimited, so no typo can silently remove the bound. |
| `AIMEE_DIM_PROBE_BUDGET_MS` | Time budget for probing an embedder's output dimension. |
| `AIMEE_PGVEC_SLOW_QUERY_MS` | Slow-query log threshold (ms) for the pgvector transport. |

### Memory

| `AIMEE_DELEGATE_WORKTREE_ROOT` | Root directory for delegate worktrees. |
| `AIMEE_DOCKER_BIN` | Docker delegate-backend binary. |
| `AIMEE_DOCKER_WORKDIR` | Docker delegate-backend working directory. |
| `AIMEE_FORWARDER_PORT` | Loopback port the in-sandbox aimee-forwarder listens on (default 3129); set by aimee when it starts the forwarder in a proxy-mode delegate container. |
| `AIMEE_FORWARDER_SOCK` | UNIX socket the in-sandbox aimee-forwarder bridges to (default /run/aimee/aimee-http.sock, the bound aimee UDS). |
| `AIMEE_PARENT_DELEGATION_ID` | Parent delegation id (threading). |
| `AIMEE_SANDBOX_HOST_MOUNTS` | Operator allowlist of host mounts available to the sandbox backend. |
| `AIMEE_SSH_BIN` | SSH delegate-backend binary. |

|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_MCP_CWD` | Working-directory hint for MCP git-root resolution. |
| `AIMEE_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE` | MCP tools/list presentation profile: 'core'/'lean' (default: Tier-0 high-frequency tools only, with find_tools/describe_tool reaching the rest) or 'full' (present every tool upfront). |
| `AIMEE_VERIFY_LOCK_FILE` | Override the host-wide file lock that serializes complete repository verification runs. |
| `AIMEE_VERIFY_PARALLEL` | Run `aimee git verify` steps in parallel. |

### Models

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_MODEL_CAPABILITY_OVERRIDES` | Override model capability flags (reasoning/tools/vision/…). |

### TLS & networking

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| `AIMEE_IR_PATH` | Diagnostic path for recording canonical request IR. |
| `AIMEE_IR_RESP_PATH` | Diagnostic path for recording canonical response IR. |
| `AIMEE_IR_SHADOW` | Run the canonical IR path in comparison/shadow mode. |

### Agents & delegates

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_EXEC_PIPE_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long a sidecar subprocess (embed, cognify, rewrite, css render, oauth token, guardrails) may run before it is killed, in ms. Default 120000. Bounds the pathological case, not normal latency: an unbounded wait here parks the calling request thread permanently when a sidecar hangs instead of exiting, which has taken a kb offline while it still accepted connections. On expiry the child's whole process GROUP is killed, because the immediate child is /bin/sh and the work is its child. |

### Managed KB and inference

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AIMEE_MANAGED_LLM_AUTH_TOKEN_OVERRIDE` | Explicit first-boot migration/adoption transport for an existing wizard-managed LLM credential. aimee-server seals it into Vault and scrubs the environment before normal startup. Ordinary inherited SYNTHESIS_API_KEY is ignored by managed credential creation so stale child-service state cannot win. Must be a 32..512 character RFC 6750 b64token. |
| `AIMEE_OFFLINE_ALLOW_NO_SWAP_MLOCK_FALLBACK` | Internal managed-authority switch: still attempts mlockall first, but when an unprivileged container cannot raise RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, permits the offline one-shot to continue only if the kernel reports no active swap. Operator-run custody tools leave this unset and retain mandatory mlockall. |

### Undocumented (add to `ENV_DESC` in gen-reference-docs.py)

> These are read by the code but have no description yet: the generator surfaces them so the reference can't silently fall behind.

`AIMEE_MCP_TOOL_PROSE`, `AIMEE_MODULE_BUS_SOCKET`, `AIMEE_MODULE_POLICY_DIR`, `AIMEE_SESSION_WORKTREE_BASE`

## External & provider environment

Standard and third-party environment variables aimee honors (scanned non-`AIMEE_*` `getenv()` reads, plus provider keys resolved via `api_key_env`). Provider API keys are credentials: their environment variable names are overridable per agent, but values are accepted only as first-boot transport, sealed into Vault, and scrubbed before services start. Standard OS variables (`HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR`, `XDG_*`, …) are used for their usual purposes and are not aimee configuration.

### Provider credentials

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key (read via the agent's `api_key_env`). |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key (read via the agent's `api_key_env`). |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_AUTH_MECHANISM` | Selects the Gemini key auth mechanism. |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google API key fallback for Gemini (via `api_key_env`). |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (default for OpenAI-family agents). |
| `SYNTHESIS_API_KEY` | Bearer credential used by the generic llm-chat sidecar; prefer the vault or a secret command. |

### Provider endpoints

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `LLAMA_HOST` | llama.cpp server host/URL. |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Ollama server host/URL for local models. |
| `SYNTHESIS_CA_FILE` | CA that verifies the synthesis sidecar's certificate on the kb -> aimee-llm hop. REPLACES the system trust store for that endpoint, so set it only for a sidecar the kb's own CA issued. |
| `SYNTHESIS_CERT_FILE` | Client certificate the kb presents to the synthesis sidecar, whose terminator requires one. Offered only to the host:port `SYNTHESIS_ENDPOINT` names. |
| `SYNTHESIS_ENDPOINT` | OpenAI-compatible base URL used by the generic llm-chat sidecar. |
| `SYNTHESIS_KEY_FILE` | Private key for `SYNTHESIS_CERT_FILE`. |
| `SYNTHESIS_MODEL` | Model requested by the generic llm-chat sidecar. |

### Network / proxy

| `CODEX_CWD` | Working directory reported by the Codex frontend. |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Codex home directory (Codex-frontend integration). |
| `CODEX_SANDBOX` | Codex sandbox mode. |
| `CODEX_THREAD_ID` | Codex conversation/thread id. |

### Undocumented (add to `EXT_DESC`/`EXT_OS_IGNORE` in gen-reference-docs.py)

`EMBEDDER_DIMS`, `EMBEDDER_URL`, `SYNTHESIS_AUTH_REQUIRED`

## Workflow engine

Workflows are block-composed YAML definitions under `$AIMEE_HOME/workflows/<name>.yaml`, authored with the `aimee workflow` CLI or the web visual composer and saved in canonical form. The Go workflow engine owns execution. A run is a durable work item pinned to a definition version.

### Workflow definition schema

```yaml
name: <id>                 # workflow name
start: <node-id>           # entry node (default: first node)
nodes:
  - id: <node-id>          # unique within the workflow
    block: <block-name>    # a built-in or custom block (see catalog)
    in:                    # typed input bindings (map: slot -> producer.output)
      <slot>: <node-id>.<output>
    params: { ... }        # block-specific params (see below)
    next: <node-id>        # unconditional successor
    on_pass: <node-id>     # gate verdict pass edge
    on_fail: <node-id>     # gate verdict fail edge (loop-back)
```

### Built-in block catalog

| Block | Required input ports and accepted artifacts | Produces |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| `author.proposal` | `proposal` (optional); accepts `proposal` | `proposal` |
| `trigger.watch-dir` | none | `proposal` |
| `author.plan` | `proposal` (required); accepts `proposal`, `intent` | `plan` |
| `implement` | `plan` (required); accepts `plan`, `intent` | `branch` |
| `document` | `branch` (required); accepts `branch` | `branch` |
| `source.archive` | `branch` (required); accepts `branch` | `branch` |
| `freeze` | `branch` (required); accepts `branch` | `frozen_diff` |
| `gate.roundtable` | `src` (required); accepts `proposal`, `plan`, `frozen_diff`; requires param `roundtable` | `verdict` |
| `gate.human` | `src` (required); accepts `proposal`, `plan`, `branch`, `frozen_diff`, `pr` | `approval` |
| `pr.open` | `src` (required); accepts `proposal`, `frozen_diff` | `pr` |
| `merge` | `pr` (required); accepts `pr` | `none` |
| `gate.ci` | `pr` (required); accepts `pr` | `verdict` |
| `check.mergeable` | `pr` (required); accepts `pr` | `verdict` |
| `understand` | none | `intent` |
| `split` | `intent` or `plan` (one required); accepts `intent`, `plan` | `plan` |
| `review` | `src` (required); accepts `frozen_diff`, `branch` | `verdict` |
| `gate.deliver` | `verdict` (required); accepts `verdict`, `approval` | `none` |
| `branch.open` | none | `branch` |
| `foreach.workflow` | `packets` (required), `feature` (required); accepts `plan`, `branch` | `branch` |

### Block parameters (`params:`)

- **Review panels:** `gate.roundtable` requires `roundtable`. Its optional `panel.required`, `panel.eligible`, and `quorum` fields select the seats. Quorum must be between one and the configured persona count.
- **Human gates:** `gate.human` parks until the browser or API records an approve or reject decision. The current record is a hashed approval artifact and lifecycle transition, not a cryptographic principal signature.
- **Loop budgets:** `max_rounds` limits repeated execution of one node. Blocks also read parameters such as `workflow`, `max_children`, `base`, `persona`, `focus`, and trigger workspace settings.

### Custom blocks: `$AIMEE_HOME/workflows/blocks.yaml`

Operator-owned and refused if it is a symlink or group/world-writable. It adds blocks to the catalog above:

```yaml
allow_command: false       # opt-in gate for command blocks
command_timeout_ms: 60000  # bounded timeout for command blocks
blocks:
  - name: <block-name>     # must not shadow a built-in or duplicate
    consumes: <artifact>   # input artifact type, or none (a source)
    produces: branch|none  # custom blocks cannot mint verdict/approval/pr
    executor: command|delegate
    command: [ /abs/path/to/tool, arg1, ... ]  # command executor, no shell
    command_sha256: <hex>  # digest of the executable
    persona: <name>        # executor: delegate
    prompt: <text>         # executor: delegate
```

### Run-level controls (not in the definition)

- **Per-node loop cap**: `params.max_rounds` bounds retries for a node that loops through `on_fail` (default `20`). Exhaustion parks the run with `retry_limit` or a more specific convergence reason. The retired `max_iters` and `on_max` fields are ignored by the Go engine.
- **Cost cap**: an optional per-work-item USD ceiling is set when the run is created. The engine parks the run when cumulative cost reaches it.
- **Trigger mode**: `interactive` or `autonomous` is recorded at admission. The current Go scheduler advances both the same way, so use `gate.human` or manual pause for an approval boundary.

### Workflow environment overrides

`AIMEE_WFE_RUNNER_URL` and `AIMEE_WFE_RUNNER_SOCKET` select a compatibility runner. `AIMEE_AUTONOMY_CONCURRENCY` supplies the startup fallback for global scheduler concurrency; live `autonomy.*` configuration then controls the running service. Legacy C variables are identified in the environment table.

## Other configuration files

Beyond the config store, aimee reads a few standalone JSON/policy files (paths under `$AIMEE_HOME` unless an env override is set).

### `agents.json`: agent / model definitions

`{"default_agent": "<name>", "agents": [ {<agent>}, … ]}`. Each agent object's non-credential fields (credential fields are vault-held and deliberately not enumerated here):

> **Undocumented agent fields** (add to `AGENT_FIELD_DESC`): `max_output`

### Toolsets: `AIMEE_TOOLSETS_CONFIG` (or the config `toolsets` map)

Named tool allowlists. `{"toolsets": {"<name>": { … }}}`; each toolset:

- `tools` / `allowed_tools`: the tool names the set permits.
- `include`: inherit another toolset's tools.
- `script`: script-tool configuration for the set.

### Guardrails: `AIMEE_GUARDRAILS_PATH`

A policy file governing path read/write classification and pre-tool enforcement (antipattern blocking). It is a behavioral policy rather than a flat key schema; the tunable thresholds are exposed as the `guardrails` section + `guardrails_semantic_*` / `guardrail_mode` keys documented above.

## Coverage & limitations

This reference is generated by scanning the canonical source tables, which covers the scalar/keyed config surface but has known blind spots. They are listed here so a reader can tell *deliberately out of scope* from *not auto-derived*:

- **Array/object element fields** are captured when the parser iterates with `cJSON_ArrayForEach` over a section's array; fields read through other access patterns (`cJSON_GetArrayItem`, indexing) or nested more than one object deep may appear only under their parent section name.
- **Env vars built at runtime** (a name assembled with `snprintf`/concatenation and passed to `getenv(var)`) are not discoverable by the string-literal scan. Provider API-key vars are the known case and are handled via each agent's `api_key_env`; only the common defaults are listed.
- **Compile-time `-D` defines** used as build-level configuration are not scanned (they are not runtime-overridable config).
- **Separate config files**: `agents.json`, toolsets, guardrails, and custom workflow blocks (`blocks.yaml`) / workflow definitions are documented in their own sections above. Per-agent field set is scanned from `agent_config.c`; the guardrails *policy* is behavioral (path classification + pre-tool enforcement), with its tunables exposed as config keys.

If the scan ever finds a config var with no description, it is emitted under an **Undocumented** heading in the relevant section, so a new option cannot silently bypass this reference.
