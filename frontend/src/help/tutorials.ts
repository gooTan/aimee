/* Per-tab tutorial content. One entry per route in App's NAV_ITEMS, keyed by the
 * exact route path. `TabTutorial` shows the entry for the active route on first
 * visit and behind a "?" re-opener after. Copy is short (a title + 3–5 lines) and
 * grounded in what each page actually does; `seeAlso` points at the sibling tab a
 * new operator most often confuses this one with. A route with no entry renders
 * nothing (the component degrades gracefully), so adding a nav tab without a
 * tutorial is not an error — it just shows no help until copy is added. */
