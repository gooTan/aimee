Compare the artifact's stated goals and deliverables to the original request; goals that cannot be traced to that request are drift. Adding work the request did not ask for is drift exactly as substituting work is: a deliverable, mechanism, file format, flag, or migration with no antecedent in the request is drift even when it would be an improvement, and generalizing a specific ask into a framework is drift. Documented technical debt is NOT drift and must never be reported as drift: unrequested work the artifact names as technical debt, deferred follow-up, a non-goal, or an open question is being handled correctly, and only planning or implementing that work is drift. Debt that is neither planned nor documented is the opposite case — an unrecorded gap — and is an ordinary finding. Severity decides what blocks, so choose it deliberately: a requirement of the original request that is unmet, wrong, or untested is foundational or blocking and must be fixed before this passes; a technical deficiency the request did not ask you to solve is a suggestion or nit, which records it as debt to act on later WITHOUT delaying delivery. Both verdicts are legitimate and you should use them together — approve with suggestion-severity deficiencies when the request is fully implemented but imperfect, and changes with the unmet requirement blocking plus the deficiencies as suggestions when it is not.Judge scope only; this is not a licence to overlook a defect. Work the request DID ask for that the artifact omits, and work it contains that is wrong or untested, remain findings in the normal way — report those as findings, not as alignment.Before deciding anything else, ENUMERATE what the original request asks for and account for each item separately. Break the request into its discrete asks -- a request that names two defects has two, a request with three bullet points has three -- and for each one state whether THIS artifact does it, citing what in the artifact does it or naming what is absent. Judge the artifact in front of you, not what a follow-up could add. An artifact that addresses some of the asks and not others is incomplete however good the part it did: report every unaddressed item as a blocking finding and use a changes verdict. Do not collapse this into alignment: an artifact that correctly implements one of two requested fixes IS aligned, and is still not done. Return only JSON shaped {\"run_id\":" + string(runIDJSON) + ",\"artifact_hash\":" + string(hashJSON) + ",\"artifact_stage\":" + string(stageJSON) + ",\"original_request_alignment\":{\"status\":\"aligned\" or \"drifted\" or \"unclear\",\"summary\":\"comparison to the original request\"},\"requirement_coverage\":[{\"requirement\":\"one discrete thing the request asked for\",\"addressed\":true or false,\"evidence\":\"what in the artifact does it, or what is missing\"}],\"verdict\":\"approve\" or \"changes\" or \"blocked\",\"findings\":[{\"id\":\"...\",\"severity\":\"foundational|blocking|suggestion|nit\",\"location\":\"...\",\"summary\":\"...\",\"recommendation\":\"...\"}]}. Foundational means the requested direction or architecture cannot work without replacement; ordinary defects, suggestions, and nits are not foundational. Echo the exact run_id, artifact_hash, and lowercase artifact_stage. Drifted, unclear, or omitted alignment must use a changes verdict. A changes verdict requires at least one actionable finding. Use blocked ONLY when the original request itself cannot be implemented as written -- it contradicts itself, or depends on something that does not exist and that no in-scope work could supply -- so that re-authoring the artifact cannot possibly help; name the missing or contradictory thing in a foundational finding. An artifact that is merely wrong, incomplete, or unclear is changes, never blocked.
