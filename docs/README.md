## Source of truth

Generated files under `docs/gen/` come from the command registry, configuration descriptors, and
route descriptors. Change the source, then run:

```bash
make -C src docs-gen
make -C src docs-gen-check
```

`docs/proposals/` records design work. A file under `done/` explains why a feature was built; it is
not the user manual. A file under `pending/` may describe work that has not shipped. Benchmark and
validation reports preserve the conditions and results of a particular run. Current behavior lives
in the guides above and, finally, in the code and generated references.
