/* session_compact.h: structured session compaction for long-running conversations.
 *
 * When a session approaches the model's context window, this module summarises
 * the older portion of the message history into a compact boundary marker and
 * preserves the most-recent turns verbatim so the agent can continue without
 * losing immediate context.
 *
 * Summary boundary structure:
 *   [CONTEXT COMPACTION — REFERENCE ONLY]
 *   ## Active Task
 *   ## Goal
 *   ## Constraints
 *   ## Completed Actions
 *   ## Active State
 *   ## In Progress
 *   ## Blocked
 *   ## Key Decisions
 *   ## Resolved Questions
 *   ## Pending User Asks
 *   ## Relevant Files
 *   [turn N+1 onward retained verbatim]
 *
 * Pressure levels (returned by session_compact_pressure):
 *   SESSION_PRESSURE_OK      — context usage is fine
 *   SESSION_PRESSURE_WARN    — approaching limit, consider preparing
 *   SESSION_PRESSURE_COMPACT — compact now before the next LLM call
