/* router_advise.h -- S1 advisory router hook.
 *
 * Runs the request->workflow router over one turn and LOGS the routed workflow to
 * the interaction-event sink. ADVISORY ONLY: it never binds a session to a
 * workflow, never enforces, and never affects the turn (S2 does the binding).
 * Fail-safe: any error is swallowed.
 *
 * The router lives at the UNIFIED gateway seam (gw_stage_router): every inbound
 * provider request -- the primary CLI over /v1/messages AND every delegate over
 * /v1/chat/completions -- passes through it, co-located with the tool-policing
 * stage. router_advise_turn is the legacy per-message entry (still carries the
 * sampled LLM classifier). */
