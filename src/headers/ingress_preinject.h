/* server/ingress_preinject.h: P1 context pre-injection for the model ingresses.
 *
 * Turns the Codex/OpenAI ingress from a transparent proxy into a context-aware
 * one: before forwarding a turn to the primary model, fusion recall produces a
 * compact <aimee-context> envelope (recommended files/symbols + an explore-with
 * pointer at Aimee's own tools) that is prepended to the request's system
 * prompt. The goal is to stop the external agent re-exploring the repo on every
 * turn — it reasons over the already-loaded context and, when it needs more,
 * explores THROUGH Aimee's MCP tools rather than raw grep.
 *
 * Opt-in: gated by config `ingress_preinject_enabled` (default off) and a
 * per-request disable (the `x-aimee-preinject: 0` header, surfaced by the
 * caller as request_disabled) so the A/B bench harness can toggle it live.
 *
 * The pure helpers (confidence tiering + envelope formatting) are unit-tested
 * without any kb dependency; the builder wires them to the live recall path.
