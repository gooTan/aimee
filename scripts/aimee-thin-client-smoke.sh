# aimee-thin-client-smoke.sh — prove the cross-platform thin `aimee` client can
# drive a remote aimee-server over the HTTP transport. This is the CLIENT axis of
# the PC step in scripts/e2e-matrix.sh:
# the SAME script runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (git-bash / CI `shell: bash`)
# because the only OS-specific thing is the `aimee` binary it invokes.
#
# Two modes:
#   * full      — a server URL is reachable: configure the HTTP transport and do
#                 a real read round-trip (`aimee session list`).
#   * selfcheck — no server reachable: only verify the client binary runs and
#                 accepts the transport config. Reported explicitly as SELFCHECK
#                 so a CI run on a host with no server never reads as a full pass.
#
# Env:
#   AIMEE_BIN     path to the aimee client      (default: aimee on PATH)
#   SERVER_URL    server base URL               (default http://localhost:8740)
#   BEARER        server bearer token           (required for full mode)
#   FORCE_MODE    full | selfcheck              (default: auto-detect by probing)
#
# Exit code: 0 = checks for the selected mode passed.
