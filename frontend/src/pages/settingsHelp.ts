 * and the owning tab's own writes) — this map only decides what Settings shows.
 * Value = where the option actually lives, shown to the operator.
 *
 * Grounded per key against the code, not by prefix:
 *
 *  - roundtable.* (the 13 preset-mirrored keys): the Roundtable tab's "make
 *    active" runs preset_overlay_config (src/modules/roundtable/roundtable_preset.c),
 *    which WRITES these exact fields from the active preset. Editing them here
 *    silently loses the edit the next time a preset is activated. The three
 *    roundtable flags that are NOT preset fields — replay_verify_enabled,
 *    chair_synthesis, require_evidence — are not listed here; they moved INTO
 *    the Roundtable tab as global options instead.
 *  - kb_curator_*: owned by the kb console's Pipeline page, which configures the
 *    curator from the live stage registry.
 *  - provider / claude_model / openai_*: owned by the Models tab. The openai_*
 *    trio only feeds the legacy fallback agent that chat_agent_add_legacy_openai
 *    (src/posix/server_compute.c) synthesizes when the roster has no match;
 *    PrimaryChooser is the supported way to set a primary.
 *  - default_persona: the Chat tab sets it per session and the Personas tab
 *    manages the roster; it already defaults to engineer.
 *
 *  - the embedder / synth tiers and the knowledge base proper: the kb
 *    runs all of them, so they are configured in the kb console's Settings page.
 *    Split by which BINARY reads the key, not by prefix — kb_mode,
 *    kb_client_url, kb_client_bearer_token and kb_evidence_emit_enabled stay
 *    here because they are aimee-server's own client/ingress config.
