"""Generate CLI + configuration reference docs from the canonical source tables.

Two committed outputs (regenerate with `make -C src docs-gen`):
  docs/gen/cli-commands.md  : every `aimee` CLI command + subcommands, from the
                               client help table (src/cli_help_data.h).
  docs/gen/configuration.md : every config key: the `aimee config get/set`
                               scalar allowlist (src/modules/config/config_fields.c) plus the
                               config-file (JSON) sections parsed by src/config*.c.

The point is completeness: these are derived from the same tables the binary
uses, so they cannot silently drift from the implementation the way hand-written
lists do.
