/* wfe_live_delegate.c: the live delegate provider for the workflow engine.
 *
 * Phase B of full-autonomous-development. Bridges the wfe_delegate_provider seam
 * (Phase A) to aimee's real delegate execution: the autonomous primary MANAGES
 * (the engine + this bridge) while delegates DO the work. For a producing block
 * (author/implement/document) this routes the block's role to a configured agent,
 * runs it WITH TOOLS pinned to the work-item worktree so it edits files in place,
 * then stages + commits the result on the work-item branch.
 *
 * Verification (build/test/lint, reviewer panel, adversarial refute) and the
 * re-delegate-on-reject loop are the engine's gate blocks (gate.ci /
 * gate.roundtable with on_fail looping back to implement) — see build.yaml — so
 * this bridge stays the narrow "run one delegate, commit its work" primitive and
 * the manager loop lives in the (auditable) engine composition.
 *
 * Registered DEFAULT-ON at server_init: autonomous development is core
 * functionality. Registration alone runs nothing — a run only begins when intake
 * creates a work item and the autonomy driver advances it. */
