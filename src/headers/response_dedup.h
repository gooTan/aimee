/* response_dedup.h: short-window response dedup for buffered ingress (§4).
 *
 * A deliberately narrow v1 cache: it short-circuits a re-sent *identical*
 * buffered, non-streaming, tool-free completion within a small TTL window, so a
 * client that retries the same request under one idempotency key does not pay
 * for the provider call twice. It is NOT a general response cache — eligibility
 * is gated by the caller (explicit idempotency key, no tools, buffered 200) and
 * the key incorporates every behaviour-affecting input the caller can see.
 *
 * Safety: the key MUST include the account/tenant boundary (principal) so one
 * caller can never read another's cached response, plus the resolved model and
 * endpoint and a hash of the exact request body. The store is bounded and
 * TTL'd; a hit records usage_kind=avoided (not spend) with the avoided cost from
 * the original realized row. */

/* Every behaviour-affecting input the ingress handler can see, folded into the

 * key is built AFTER agent/config resolution — so two requests that resolve to a
 * different backend or behaviour config never collide. principal is the account
 * boundary (empty -> "anon"); source is the turn-origin/account source; body,
 * context (the pre-injected <aimee-context> envelope), and behavior_flags (a
 * string of the generation-affecting config flags) are hashed so the key stays
